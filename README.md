# Machine-Learning-in-Practice-Python

## Goal
The goal of this repository is to implement some basic machine learning algorithms. The code in this repository will be almost exactly the same as provided by the tutorials given on:
https://pythonprogramming.net/machine-learning-tutorial-python-introduction/

These algorithms help give some deeper understanding in how they work and how to create them using Python.

## Done
Linear Regression <br />
K Nearest Neighbors <br />

## In Progress
Support Vector Machines <br />

## Future 
Clustering <br />
Neural Networks <br />
Deep Learning with TensorFlow <br />
